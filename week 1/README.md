TwoSum:

The idea is Fast search look up algorithm

Using cache memory for fast retrieval n

You can also use two pointer algorithm to cut the workload to n/2

Clarifying Questions: 
1. Empty List
2. Different Data Type instead of Array?
3. Maximum/Minimum amount of elements in the List
4. What is the number type of the element in the Array? 
5. Maximum/Minimum Range of each element
6. How many solutions can there be?
7. Handling No solutions

Pattern:
Utilizes Hashing Data Structure with a search algortithm to find the solution.
