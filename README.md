# Grind 91 Practice

### Schedule
- Total Time: 26 Weeks
- Time per Week: 3 hours per week

At least 1 Question a weekday! Some days I catch myself doing 2 or 3. If I miss one day, it is easy to recover and get back on track.

### Goal

This list is adapted to my work and life schedule and is sustainable long term for me.

- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [How To Get Started](#how-to-get-started)
- [My Approach to Algorithm Studying](#my-approach-to-algorithm-studying)
- Week 1
  - [TwoSum](https://github.com/chitangchin/Grind75Practice/blob/main/week%201/twoSum.js)

### Prerequisites
- VSCode
- Node.js

### How To Get Started
```
npm ci
```
- This will install all dependencies for this project.

```
npm test
```
- Unit tests that I created for each algorithm problem

You can test individual algorithms:
```
npm test twoSum
```
- This will test only the twoSum algorithm.

### My Approach to Algorithm Studying

**Brainless repetition** is a waste of time and resources in my opinion.

So my approach with Grind 91 is to do the following:
- Identify real use cases
- Understand Algorithm and Data Structure Patterns

You will find within each problem solved is a <ins>Real World Case scenario</ins> if applicable and the <ins>General Pattern</ins>

**However**, there is a fine line that I have to avoid for falling into the hole of Data Structures and Algos. I may end up wasting a lot of time if I do this.
